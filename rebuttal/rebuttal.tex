I would like to thank the examiners for the fruitful discussions and constructive feedback on my Ph.D. work. 
This document summarises the corrections made to the thesis. Each correction is also highlighted in the thesis document.

\section*{General comments}
\subsubsection*{Comment 1}
\begin{quote}\emph{``Please be more careful with the use of both “proof” (page 91) and “optimal” (pages 84, 100). “optimal” has to be put into context explaining the cost function and underlying assumptions; and “proof” should only ever be used when there is a formal proof of a theorem.''}\end{quote}
I removed the use of "proof" in page 91 and made sure that the word is not misused anywhere else. I also fixed all occurrences of the word ``optimal'' (pages 43, 48, 49, 84, 100, 102, 104, 120).

\subsubsection*{Comment 2}
\begin{quote}\emph{``Please be consistent with “E” and “I” notation for identity matrices.''}\end{quote}
The symbol $\mathbf{E}$ is now consistently used for denoting an identity matrix. The changes were made in Equations 4.18, 4.21, 4.33, 4.35, 6.3, 6.17, and pages 47, 83, 101.

\section*{Chapter 1: Introduction}

\begin{quote}\emph{``Please provide some more context around newer trends, specifically 3D generative models as well as deep learning along with some reasoning about why you have decided not to pursue these directions.''}\end{quote}

\section*{Chapter 2: Literature Review}
\subsubsection*{Comment 1}
\begin{quote}\emph{``Page 18: “methodologies that that employ”: please correct.''}\end{quote}
Fixed.

\section*{Chapter 3: Basic Definitions and Notation}
\subsubsection*{Comment 1}
\begin{quote}\emph{``Equation (3.12): Is there a reason for the order of variables to be the inverse of the shape model? If not, please make it consistent.''}\end{quote}
Fixes. The model notations are now made consistent.

\section*{Chapter 6: Automatic Construction of Deformable Models}
\subsubsection*{Comment 1}
\begin{quote}\emph{``Figure 6.2: Please clarify that the figure was taken from Stefanos’ paper.''}\end{quote}
Fixed.

\subsubsection*{Comment 2}
\begin{quote}\emph{``You claim that the IG features are better separating the PCA enabling the somewhat magical convergence of the automatic construction of the model. In our discussion, however, we found that it works just as well with SIFT. Please clarify, as otherwise the claim is misleading.''}\end{quote}

\subsubsection*{Comment 3}
\begin{quote}\emph{``Why does [157] not appear in the graphs of the evaluation? It seems there is a wrong citation. Please correct.''}\end{quote}
The citations in the legends where wrong. They are now fixed for Figures 7.5, 7.6 and 7.10.

\section*{Conclusion}
\subsubsection*{Comment 1}
\begin{quote}\emph{``“with the gradient descent directions from Gauss-Newton optimization”: strictly speaking this is not gradient descent, since Gauss-Newton is a second order method... Please adjust.''}\end{quote}
Fixed in pages 131 and 136.
