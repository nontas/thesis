\section{Thesis Outline}
Chapter~\ref{ch:literature} makes a review of the related literature on the
main two topics of this Ph.D. thesis: landmark localization with Deformable
Models and their unsupervised training. Chapter~\ref{ch:notation} provides the basic definitions and notations that apply to all the topics of this thesis.
Then, the remainder of the thesis is
split in two parts, each one consisting of two chapters.
Part~\ref{part:generative_models} focuses on generative Deformable Models.
Specifically, Chapter~\ref{ch:aam} presents feature-based holistic Active
Appearance Models and Chapter~\ref{ch:aps} proposes Active Pictorial
Structures, a novel part-based generative Deformable Model.
Part~\ref{part:generative_discriminative} combines the main concepts of
generative and discriminative Deformable Models with two applications:
Chapter~\ref{ch:automatic_training} shows how to automatically train deformable
Models without the need of manually annotated data, whereas
Chapter~\ref{ch:acr} presents Adaptive Cascaded Regression which achieves
state-of-the-art performance on face alignment in-the-wild.
Finally, Chapter~\ref{ch:conclusion} concludes the thesis.
