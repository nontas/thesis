\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:automatic_training:conclusions}
In this chapter, we proposed a method for automatic construction of Deformable
Models. The method iteratively trains a generative and a discriminative AAM 
ending up with a powerful model. The only requirements of the method are a
statistical shape model and a set of in-the-wild images with their bounding
boxes, which means that it can be applied to any object. Our experiments on
faces show that the method outperforms discriminative state-of-the-art methods
trained on manual annotations. This is the first, to the best of our knowledge,
methodology to automatically building a Deformable Model that demonstrates such
promising results.
