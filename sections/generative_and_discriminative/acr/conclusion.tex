\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:acr:conclusion}
In this chapter, we have shown that by combining the descent directions of
cascaded regression and Gauss-Newton
optimization, we can achieve both robustness to challenging initializations
and accuracy with respect to fine details. We report
state-of-the-art performance on the task of facial alignment, using the most
recent benchmark challenge and have experimentally verified that ACR outperforms
both AAM and SDM for a range of initializations.
