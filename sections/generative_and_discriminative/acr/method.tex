\section{Method}\label{sec:acr:method}
In the following sections, we follow the notation of
Secs.~\ref{sec:notation:shape} and~\ref{sec:notation:appearance} for the shape
and appearance models, respectively. Specifically, we employ the same shape representation
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{s} = \left[\boldsymbol{\ell}_1^{\mathsf{T}}, \boldsymbol{\ell}_2^{\mathsf{T}}, \ldots, \boldsymbol{\ell}_n^{\mathsf{T}} \right]^{\mathsf{T}} = \left[x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, \ldots, x_n, y_n \right]^{\mathsf{T}}
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
as well as a shape model of the form of Eq.~\ref{equ:shape_model}. With some
abuse of notation, let us redefine the shape generation formulation of
Eq.~\ref{equ:shape_generation} as a function, \ie,
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{s}(\mathbf{p})=\bar{\mathbf{s}} + \mathbf{U}_s\mathbf{p}
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
where $\mathbf{p}=[p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_{n_s}]^{\mathsf{T}}$ is the $n_s\times1$
vector of \emph{shape parameters} that control the linear combination of the
eigenvectors.

Moreover, we employ a part-based appearance representation as explained in
Sec.~\ref{sec:notation:part_based}. With some abuse of notation, we redefine
Eq.~\ref{equ:part_based_appearance} as a function, \ie,
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{s}) = \left[ \mathcal{F}(\mathbf{t}_{\boldsymbol{\ell}_1})^{\mathsf{T}}, \mathcal{F}(\mathbf{t}_{\boldsymbol{\ell}_2})^{\mathsf{T}}, \ldots,
  \mathcal{F}(\mathbf{t}_{\boldsymbol{\ell}_n})^{\mathsf{T}} \right]^{\mathsf{T}}
  \label{equ:feature_function_acr}
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We also create an appearance model following the description of
Sec.~\ref{sec:notation:appearance_model}, which can be used to generate new
appearance vectors with the function
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}\label{equ:appearance_model}
    \mathbf{a}(\mathbf{c}) = \bar{\mathbf{a}} + \mathbf{U}_a\mathbf{c}
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
where $\mathbf{c}=[c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_{n_a}]^{\mathsf{T}}$ is the $n_a\times1$
vector of \emph{appearance parameters}. Finally, let us define
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}\label{equ:projection_matrix}
    \mathbf{P} = \mathbf{E}-\mathbf{U}_a\mathbf{U}_a^{\mathsf{T}}
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
which is the orthogonal complement of the appearance subspace $\mathbf{U}_a$,
where $\mathbf{E}$ denotes the $mn\times mn$ identity matrix. This projection
operator is used in order to project-out the appearance variance in the
following methods.

In the following sections, we present details of the discriminative
(Sec.~\ref{subsec:regression}) and generative (Sec.~\ref{subsec:generative})
models in order to formulate our unified model (Sec.~\ref{subsec:acr}).
